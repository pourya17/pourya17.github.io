### CPSC 120

* Lab 11

    Lab 11 was a favorite because it was the first time I used object-oriented programming in C++. In part 2, we implemented OOP into our Hilo game using the “GameState” class, which was fun. Using the class as a blueprint, we created different member functions for when the guess was too high, too low, or correct, for example.

* Lab 6

    Lab 6 was a favorite because we got to use loops in C++ for the first time. In part 2, we used a for-each loop to go through the command-line arguments and return the average of the numbers the user provided. The experience of using loops in my code was great.

* Lab 4

    Lab 4 was a favorite because that was when we started using if statements. In part 2, we used if statements for our Hilo game. The statements were executed if player two’s guesses were too high, too low, or correct. Lab 4 was when we started to dive deeper into computer programming, and I really enjoyed it.
